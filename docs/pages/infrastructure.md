## Kubernetes

Production products are deployed in containers(micro-service) within a [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster. Rancher is used for cluster management and deployments.

1. Highly available
1. Horizontal Scalable: Products have the ability to scale up or down based on demand.

### AWS EKS

The production clusters are using [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) infrastructure with compute nodes using AWS EC2 instances.

```{note}
AWS EKS runs the Kubernetes control plane across multiple Availability Zones, automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane nodes, and provides on-demand, zero downtime upgrades and patching. EKS offers a 99.95% uptime SLA. At the same time, the EKS console provides observability of your Kubernetes clusters so you can identify and resolve issues faster.
```

#### EKS Worker Nodes

The EKS worker nodes are rotated on an annual basis. EC2 instance provides on-demand security patches.
