# BitCurator

There is a desktop in E1B25A (the Digital Archives Lab) running a distro based on an LTS release of Ubuntu in E1B25A. This is for [BitCurator](https://bitcurator.net/bitcurator/), a tool used for digital forensics.

Walker Sampson is the primary contact for the machine. It is primarily used Monday 9:00-11:00, Tuesday 2:00-4:00, Wednesday 9:00-11:00, Thursday 2:00-4:00, and Friday 2:30-4:30.

If updates are required you can use the Software Update application in Ubuntu or using `apt` via the command line.
